    <h2 class="text-center">Our Goal</h2>
    <h3 class="text-center">Our mission is to provide a platform for students to voice their concerns while discovering new people and resources.</h3>
    <p class="text-center">We are Bayreach, a nonprofit composed by and for the students of Homestead, and the creators of a platform for students to voice their concerns, opinions, suggestions, and perspectives to help make our school a better place. By providing this platform, and other helpful information and resources, we hope to improve the student experience and allow the student body to be accurately represented and understood by the programs that are meant to serve it, such as ASB and the School Administration. We can only achieve this goal together––join us today to become part of Bayreach and demand your voice be heard!</p>

     <p class="text-center">We here at Bayreach are a team of highschoolers who got together to achieve a common goal: to help out our friends. We are motivated by the desire to help out our fellow peers by improving the environment in which we spend a large chunk of our time. In the end, we all come to school, like it or not, to learn. We will work tirelessly to bring about our contributions to a community that has always given; It's just about time for us to give back.</p>
